### Starting your server

1. Open the server's folder
2. Run either `start.bat` \(Windows\) or `start.sh` \(other operating systems\)
3. The server will not start because you need to accept the EULA
4. Open the `eula.txt` file in the server's folder and change `eula=false` to `eula=true`

{% hint style="danger" %}
You MUST accept the EULA to use your server. Please read through it carefully.
{% endhint %}
