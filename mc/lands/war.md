# Wars

## Declaring war

Declaring war is quite simple, actually. All you have to do is run the following command: `/war declare <land/nation>`

{% hint style="info" %}
A land/nation must have a balance of at least $1,000 in order to partake in wars. The Land/Nation must also be older than 1 real-life day.
{% endhint %}

It will then ask you about a tribute. This is the amount of money they have to pay if they want to surrender. Setting the tribute to $0 will make it so the defender can't surrender. You \(the attacker\) can surrender at any time for 50% of your Land/Nation balance. The enemy will then receive the declaration of war with all the information. They will have 2 real-life days to respond to the declaration.

Once the declaration is accepted, you will have 3 real-life hours to prepare. If you'd like info on the war, use `/war info`. A good strategy is to block up any exposed chests, doors/trapdoors, and redstone mechanisms.

## War

The war will last 72 real-life hours \(3 days\). Griefing is not the objective of wars, killing is, the Land/Nation with the most kills wins. Both parties will be able to:

* Break vines, ladders, scaffolding, obsidian, and crying obsidian
* Place vines, ladders, and scaffolding
* Kill players in each other's Land \(Land**s** if it's a Nation war\)
  * You will not be able to damage your teammates \(unless you're in the Wilderness\)
* Loot containers
* Open doors/trapdoors
* Use redstone \(levers, buttons, pressure plates, etc...\)

{% hint style="info" %}
A minimum of 1 defender must be online for the attackers to pillage their base. If that player leaves, there will be a 1-minute cooldown where the attackers will still be able to pillage.
{% endhint %}

## End of war

* Either side wins
  * The winner will get 75% of the loser's Land/Nation balance
  * Both sides will get a war shield for 5 days
* Defender surrenders
  * The defender will pay the tribute to the attacker
  * The defender will get a war shield for 3 days
  * The attacker will get the tribute that the defenders paid
  * The attacker will get a war shield for 5 days
* Attacker surrenders
  * The attacker will pay 50% of their Land/Nation balance to the defender
  * The attacker will get a war shield for 3 days
  * The defender will get the 50% surrender cost from the attacker
  * The defender will get a war shield for 5 days
