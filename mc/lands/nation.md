# Starting a Nation

What is a nation you say? Well, a nation is basically a collection of more than one Lands. Think of a nation as the U.S., and the Lands being the 50 states. Starting a nation is simple, just run the following command: `/n create <name>`

{% hint style="warning" %}
It costs $10,000 to create a Nation \(2x more than a Land\).
{% endhint %}

## Trusting Lands

Now that you have a nation, you want to add more lands to it! To trust a Land, use this command: `/n trust <land>` _To untrust a Land, simply replace `trust` with `untrust`._

## Nation Wars

Nation wars work exactly the same as Land wars, go read the previous page to get familiarized with it.

{% hint style="danger" %}
When starting a Nation war, all Lands apart of the Nation\(s\) will be invovled.
{% endhint %}

## Nation Upkeep

So, once a Land joins a Nation, the **land** no longer pays upkeep to the **server**, instead it goes to the **Nation**. However, the **Nation** still has to pay upkeep to the **server**. This is an important part of a Nation because if you don't pay upkeep, you won't be able to have a Nation.
